        ## üîÑ Template Compliance Automation
        
        The project includes automated template compliance validation:
        
        ### Current Quality Gates:
        - **Japanese Standards Validation**: Checks organizational principles
        - **Template Compliance Validation**: Verifies structure and status tags
        - **Root Directory Cleanliness**: Ensures proper file organization
        - **Test Artifact Lifecycle**: Validates test file management
        
        ### Automated Tools:
        - **documentation-lifecycle-management.yml**: Comprehensive validation workflow
        - **project-cleanliness-validation.yml**: Organization and cleanliness checks
        - **quality_automation.py**: Integrated quality validation script
        
        ## üõ†Ô∏è How This Issue Will Be Processed:
        
        1. **Validation**: Issue will be validated against current quality gates
        2. **Classification**: Assigned to appropriate Japanese development standard  
        3. **Automation Check**: Evaluated for automated fix potential
        4. **Implementation**: Fixed manually or via automated tools
        5. **Prevention**: Enhanced validation added if needed
