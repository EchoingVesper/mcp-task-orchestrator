# Files Created in This Context Session

*Record of all architectural specifications persisted to disk*

## üéØ Purpose
This document tracks all files created during the file tracking architecture design session to ensure complete persistence and prevent context loss.

## üìÅ Files Created and Persisted

### Architecture Specifications
1. **`docs/architecture/file-change-tracking-system.md`**
   - Core file operation tracking system architecture
   - FileOperationTracker and FileVerificationEngine specifications
   - Context recovery system design

2. **`docs/architecture/file-tracking-database-schema.md`**
   - Database schema for file operations tracking
   - Verification results table design
   - Enhanced subtasks table modifications

3. **`docs/architecture/decision-documentation-framework.md`**
   - Architectural Decision Record (ADR) structure
   - Decision capture workflow specifications
   - Integration with subtask execution

4. **`docs/architecture/decision-documentation-schema.md`**
   - Database schema for decision tracking
   - Decision evolution and impact tracking tables
   - Relationship mapping structures

### Implementation Planning
5. **`docs/planning/file-tracking-implementation-roadmap.md`**
   - Critical priority implementation plan
   - Phase-based development strategy
   - Technical requirements and success criteria

### Updated Documentation  
6. **`docs/prompts/handover_prompt.md`** (UPDATED)
   - Critical priority shift to file tracking implementation
   - Complete status update with new architecture
   - Next action commands for immediate implementation

7. **`docs/planning/files-created-this-session.md`** (this file)
   - Record of all files created for context preservation

## ‚úÖ Verification Status

**All Critical Architecture**: ‚úÖ PERSISTED TO DISK
**Implementation Readiness**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE SPECIFICATIONS  
**Context Recovery**: ‚úÖ ALL NECESSARY DOCUMENTATION SAVED
**Next Session Ready**: ‚úÖ IMMEDIATE IMPLEMENTATION POSSIBLE

## üö® Critical Implementation Priority

**Status**: Architecture complete, implementation REQUIRED before other work
**Risk**: All work lost without file tracking system
**Next Action**: Begin implementation of file tracking infrastructure immediately
