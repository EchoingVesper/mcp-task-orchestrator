## Version Progression Strategy

### Semantic Versioning Framework
Following strict semantic versioning (SemVer) principles:

```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (e.g., 1.5.2)

MAJOR: Breaking changes or fundamental architecture shifts
MINOR: New features, backward-compatible enhancements  
PATCH: Bug fixes, documentation updates, performance improvements
```

### Release Cadence
- **Major Releases**: Every 9-12 months for significant architecture changes
- **Minor Releases**: Every 3-4 months for new features and enhancements
- **Patch Releases**: As needed for critical fixes and improvements
- **Pre-release Versions**: Alpha/Beta releases 4-6 weeks before stable
