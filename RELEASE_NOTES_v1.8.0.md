# MCP Task Orchestrator v1.8.0 Release Notes

## ðŸš€ Workspace Paradigm Implementation

Version 1.8.0 introduces a major architectural enhancement: the **Workspace Paradigm**. This transformative update automatically detects your project context and intelligently organizes task artifacts within your development workspace.

### What's New

#### Smart Workspace Detection
- **Automatic Project Recognition**: Detects common project markers including:
  - `package.json` (Node.js/JavaScript projects)
  - `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py` (Python projects)
  - `Cargo.toml` (Rust projects)
  - `go.mod` (Go projects)
  - `pom.xml` (Maven/Java projects)
  - `.git` directories (Git repositories)
  - And many more...

- **Intelligent Artifact Organization**: Tasks and their outputs are now automatically saved to your project's root directory, keeping your work organized and accessible.

#### Database Architecture Evolution
- **Workspace-Aware Storage**: All database tables now include `workspace_id` columns for proper workspace isolation
- **Automatic Migration**: Seamless upgrade from session-based to workspace-based storage
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing tasks and data are preserved during the upgrade

### Critical Bug Fixes

#### Database Migration System
- âœ… **Fixed SQLAlchemy 2.0+ Compatibility**: Resolved `'RootTransaction' object has no attribute 'execute'` errors
- âœ… **Enhanced Transaction Handling**: Proper connection management with `engine.connect()` patterns
- âœ… **Raw SQL Wrapping**: All SQL executions now use `text()` wrapper for safety

#### Server Architecture
- âœ… **Import Conflict Resolution**: Eliminated server.py vs server/ package naming conflicts
- âœ… **Package Restructuring**: Renamed conflicting directories for cleaner imports
- âœ… **Enhanced Reliability**: Improved server startup and MCP client communication

#### Logging System
- âœ… **Claude Code Compatibility**: Fixed false error messages in debug logs
- âœ… **Stream Separation**: INFO messages to stdout, warnings/errors to stderr
- âœ… **Cleaner Output**: Eliminated confusing error labels on successful operations

### Enhanced User Experience

#### For Developers
- **Zero Configuration**: Workspace detection works automatically
- **Better Organization**: Artifacts appear in logical project locations
- **Improved Debugging**: Cleaner log output with proper error classification

#### For AI Assistants
- **Context Awareness**: Better understanding of project structure
- **Efficient Workflows**: Tasks naturally align with development workspace
- **Enhanced Persistence**: Workspace-based task recovery and continuation

### Migration Guide

#### Automatic Upgrade
The upgrade to v1.8.0 is **fully automatic**:
1. Database schema migrates seamlessly on first startup
2. Existing tasks are preserved and accessible
3. New workspace detection activates immediately
4. No configuration changes required

#### What Happens
- **First Startup**: Database migration adds workspace support (~ 1 second)
- **Task Recovery**: All existing tasks remain available
- **New Behavior**: Future tasks use workspace-aware organization
- **Compatibility**: Full backward compatibility maintained

### Installation

```bash
# Update existing installation
pipx upgrade mcp-task-orchestrator

# Or fresh installation
pipx install mcp-task-orchestrator
```

### Performance Improvements

- **Migration System**: Enhanced reliability with comprehensive error handling
- **Database Operations**: Optimized workspace-aware queries
- **Memory Management**: Improved resource utilization during startup
- **Error Recovery**: Better handling of edge cases and unexpected conditions

### Testing & Quality

- âœ… **Comprehensive Testing**: All workspace detection scenarios validated
- âœ… **Migration Testing**: Database upgrade paths thoroughly tested  
- âœ… **Integration Testing**: MCP client compatibility verified
- âœ… **Backward Compatibility**: Legacy functionality preserved

### Next Steps

With the workspace paradigm in place, future releases will focus on:
- Enhanced workspace-aware features
- Advanced project context understanding
- Intelligent artifact management
- Cross-workspace task coordination
