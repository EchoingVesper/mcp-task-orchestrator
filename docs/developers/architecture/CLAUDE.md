**[CURRENT]** Claude Code guidance for Architecture Documentation in MCP Task Orchestrator

‚ö†Ô∏è **File Size Compliant**: This file is kept under 400 lines for Claude Code stability

#
# Status Header

- **Status**: [CURRENT]

- **Last Updated**: 2025-01-08

- **Context**: Architecture Documentation and Design Decisions

- **Architecture Layer**: Documentation (cross-cutting architectural concerns)

#
# Context Analysis

#
## Directory Purpose

Comprehensive architecture documentation covering Clean Architecture implementation, design decisions, and system structure.

#
## Scope

- Clean Architecture design patterns and implementation guides

- Database schema documentation and enhancements

- System component architecture and interactions

- Design decision documentation and rationale

- Architectural pattern explanations and usage

#
## Architectural Role

Provides architectural guidance for the Clean Architecture implementation:

- Documents design decisions and their rationale

- Explains architectural patterns and their application

- Guides implementation across all system layers

- Ensures consistency in architectural approaches

#
# Critical File Size Warning

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL: FILE SIZE LIMITS FOR CLAUDE CODE STABILITY** ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Maximum File Size**: 500 lines (300-400 lines recommended)
**Risk**: Files exceeding 500 lines can cause Claude Code to crash

**Architecture Files in THIS Directory Exceeding Limits**:

- `database-schema-enhancements.md` (694 lines) - HIGH RISK

- `nested-task-architecture.md` (554 lines) - MEDIUM RISK

**Architecture Documentation Best Practices**:

1. Split large architecture docs by component or layer

2. Use separate files for diagrams and detailed specs

3. Create overview files that link to detailed docs

4. Keep decision records concise (under 300 lines)

5. Use appendices for lengthy technical details

# Development Patterns

#
## Creating Architecture Documentation

1. Follow Architecture Decision Record (ADR) format for decisions

2. Include context, problem statement, and solution rationale

3. Document alternatives considered and trade-offs

4. Maintain file size under 500 lines (split if necessary)

5. Include implementation examples and patterns

#
## Architecture Review Process

1. Review architectural decisions against clean architecture principles

2. Validate layer separation and dependency direction

3. Ensure documentation accuracy and completeness

4. Check for compliance with established patterns

5. Update cross-references and related documentation

#
## Documentation Organization

- **Overview Files**: High-level summaries linking to detailed docs

- **Component Files**: Specific architectural components and patterns

- **Decision Files**: Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

- **Implementation Files**: Detailed implementation guidance

- **Pattern Files**: Reusable architectural patterns

#
# Integration Points

#
## Clean Architecture Integration

- **Domain Layer**: Document business logic and entity design

- **Application Layer**: Document use case orchestration patterns

- **Infrastructure Layer**: Document implementation patterns and adapters

- **Presentation Layer**: Document interface design and protocols

#
## Documentation Architecture Integration

- Links to main documentation architecture guide

- Cross-references with implementation-specific CLAUDE.md files

- Integration with testing documentation for validation

- Coordination with operational documentation in scripts/

#
## Design Decision Integration

- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) document major decisions

- Decision documentation framework ensures consistency

- Integration with implementation guides for practical application

- Cross-referencing with related architectural concerns

#
# Troubleshooting

#
## Common Issues

- **File Size Violations**: Split large files into focused components

- **Broken Cross-References**: Validate links when restructuring documentation

- **Outdated Patterns**: Regular review against current implementation

- **Inconsistent Terminology**: Maintain architectural vocabulary consistency

#
## Debugging Architecture Issues

# Check architectural compliance

# Analyze dependency violations

# Check documentation consistency

python scripts/validation/documentation_consistency.py
```text

#
## Performance Considerations

- Keep documentation files under 500 lines for Claude Code stability

- Use overview files with links for large architectural topics

- Organize by architectural layer and component for clarity

- Maintain clear separation between different architectural concerns
