# Security diagnostic commands
python -m mcp_task_orchestrator_cli.validation_backup_system --security-check
python scripts/diagnostics/check_status.py --security
```

**Security Report Includes**:
- Permission audit results
- Configuration integrity status
- File system security status
- Network security validation
- Vulnerability assessment summary

## Incident Response

### Automatic Security Response

**Threat Detection & Response**:
