**Progress**: 1/6 subtasks complete  
**Status**: Research phase complete, specialist resolution phases pending  

**Completed Subtasks**:
- ✅ `researcher_d44647` - Task Status Analysis and Categorization (COMPLETE)

**Pending Subtasks** (awaiting execution):
- 🔄 `documenter_886e82` - Documentation Work Stream Resolution  
- 🔄 `tester_fb7643` - Testing Work Stream Resolution

- **6 tasks** in documentation enhancement work stream (orphaned, investigate)
- **4 tasks** in testing infrastructure work stream (stale, evaluate for closure)
- **Analysis Document**: `docs/planning/task-cleanup-analysis.md`

### Outstanding Work Stream Cleanup Required 🔄
**Issue Identified**: 10 orphaned tasks from different work streams need investigation and resolution. Comprehensive analysis completed, specialist resolution phases ready for execution.

**Next Steps**: Continue executing `task_392260e3` subtasks in dependency order to achieve clean orchestrator state.
## 🔮 Transition Strategy: Moving Beyond Manual Handovers

### Current Limitations of Manual Handover Approach
1. **Manual Effort**: Requires human documentation of planning status
2. **Context Loss Risk**: Important details may be missed between sessions
3. **Synchronization Issues**: Multiple planning streams may become disconnected
4. **Scalability Concerns**: Becomes unwieldy with complex multi-phase projects

### Future Orchestrator Native Features (Planned)
1. **Automatic Session Persistence**: Context preservation across conversation boundaries
2. **Project State Management**: Automatic tracking of planning phases and decisions
3. **Smart Handover Generation**: AI-generated context summaries based on task history
4. **Cross-Session Memory**: Persistent project knowledge and decision rationale
5. **Multi-Agent Context Sharing**: Seamless context transfer between different AI agents
6. **Task Lifecycle Tracking**: Automatic inclusion of active orchestrator tasks in handover context
7. **Work Stream Management**: Better organization and tracking of related task groups

### Migration Path
- **Short Term**: Continue using manual handover documentation with active task tracking
- **Medium Term**: Implement prototype orchestrator features for session context and task persistence
- **Long Term**: Full transition to orchestrator-managed project continuity

**Current Manual Approach**: Active orchestrator tasks (`task_392260e3`) manually included in handover prompt for session continuity until native features are implemented.

## 🎯 Current Priorities

### A2A Framework Integration Design: COMPLETE ✅
The primary planning objectives have been successfully completed:
- ✅ Clear architectural specifications for upcoming features
- ✅ Comprehensive feature documentation and requirements
- ✅ Updated version planning and roadmap
- ✅ Enhanced testing and integration strategies

### Next Session Recommendations
1. **Task Cleanup Investigation**: Investigate and resolve remaining 10 pending tasks from different work streams
2. **Implementation Planning**: Begin implementation phase for A2A framework based on completed specifications
3. **Testing Strategy Execution**: Implement the testing strategy documented in planning phase
4. **Feature Development**: Begin development cycle based on feature specifications

### Context Preservation for Next Session
- **Project State**: Post-1.4.0 release, A2A framework design COMPLETE, task cleanup in progress
- **Active Orchestrator Task**: `task_392260e3` (1/6 subtasks complete)
- **Architecture Phase**: COMPLETE with 7 comprehensive documents created
- **Current Issue**: 10 orphaned tasks requiring systematic investigation and resolution
- **Success Criteria**: Clean orchestrator state and clear implementation roadmap
- **Integration Requirements**: Maintain compatibility with existing Claude Code coordination patterns
- **Analysis Available**: Task categorization and feasibility assessment in `docs/planning/task-cleanup-analysis.md`

### Identified Orchestrator Enhancement Need
**Task Lifecycle Management**: The presence of orphaned pending tasks highlights a need for better:
- Automatic task cleanup and lifecycle management
- Work stream isolation and completion tracking
- Session boundary management for task persistence
- Automatic detection of abandoned or incomplete task groups
- **Enhancement Task**: `architect_3fd5ac` will provide recommendations during cleanup process
## 🔧 Technical Context

- **Content Standards**: Focus on planning status, technical context, and next priorities
- **Transition Planning**: Document progress toward orchestrator native features

### Quality Standards
- Maintain clear separation between completed work and active planning
- Include specific task IDs and orchestrator context when available
- Document integration patterns and technical decisions for continuity
- Provide actionable next steps for session continuation

## 🚀 Next Action Command

**Current Priority**: Continue task cleanup investigation (task_392260e3) to achieve clean orchestrator state

**Recommended Action**:
```
Continue executing task_392260e3 (Task Cleanup and Work Stream Resolution) by running the pending specialist subtasks in dependency order, starting with documenter_886e82, tester_fb7643, and implementer_cdaf16.
```

**Current Task Context**:
- **Active Task**: `task_392260e3` - Task Cleanup Investigation
- **Progress**: 1/6 subtasks complete (research analysis done)
- **Analysis Available**: `docs/planning/task-cleanup-analysis.md` 
- **Next Subtasks**: documenter_886e82, tester_fb7643, implementer_cdaf16 (can run in parallel)

**Expected Outcomes**:
- Resolution of 10 orphaned tasks across documentation and testing work streams
- Clean task orchestrator state with no stale or orphaned tasks
- Task lifecycle management recommendations for orchestrator enhancement
- Clear state for A2A framework implementation phase

*📝 **Temporary Document Notice**: This manual handover approach will be deprecated once orchestrator native session persistence and context management features are implemented. The goal is to eliminate the need for manual project continuity documentation through automated orchestrator capabilities.*
