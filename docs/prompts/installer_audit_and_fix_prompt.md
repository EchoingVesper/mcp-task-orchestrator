# MCP Task Orchestrator Installer Audit and Remediation

## Objective
Audit and completely rebuild the MCP Task Orchestrator installer and uninstaller implementations against the newly created MCP configuration documentation standards.

## Context
- Fresh MCP documentation has been created covering installation best practices
- Current installer is malfunctioning with unsafe practices (e.g., dumping entire PATH into config files)
- Need both installer and uninstaller rebuilt to modern standards
- Must maintain compatibility with existing MCP ecosystems

## Critical Requirements

### Safety First
- **NEVER break existing MCP configurations** - only modify task orchestrator-specific entries
- **Surgical precision** - identify and modify only relevant configuration sections
- **Backup before modification** - create restore points for all config changes
- **Validate all changes** - ensure configurations remain syntactically valid

### Implementation Standards
- Follow patterns documented in the newly created MCP research files
- Use absolute paths and proper Python module execution patterns (-m)
- Implement minimal environment variable usage
- Apply registry-based approach for cross-tool compatibility

## Required Tasks

### 1. Current Implementation Audit
**Analyze existing installer code against documentation:**
- Compare current patterns with recommended practices from research documents
- Identify all deviations from best practices
- Document specific issues (like the PATH dumping problem)
- Create comprehensive list of required changes

**Security and Safety Assessment:**
- Identify potentially dangerous practices in current implementation
- Document configuration pollution issues
- Assess impact on existing MCP server configurations

### 2. Installer Redesign
**Configuration Generation:**
- Implement proper configuration patterns per research documentation
- Use absolute paths and standardized Python execution
- Apply tool-specific format requirements correctly
- Ensure minimal, clean configuration entries

**Cross-Tool Compatibility:**
- Support Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, and other documented tools
- Implement intelligent tool detection and appropriate config format selection
- Use registry-based approach for universal compatibility

**Error Handling and Validation:**
- Validate all configuration changes before writing
- Provide clear error messages for common failure scenarios
- Implement rollback capability for failed installations

### 3. Uninstaller Rebuild
**Surgical Removal Capability:**
- Identify task orchestrator-specific configuration entries precisely
- Remove old malformed configurations from previous installer versions
- Preserve all other MCP servers and configuration sections
- Handle multiple configuration formats across different tools

**Legacy Cleanup:**
- Remove artifacts from previous poorly-implemented installer versions
- Clean up any PATH pollution or other configuration contamination
- Restore configurations to clean state while preserving other MCP servers

**Validation and Safety:**
- Verify configuration file integrity after modifications
- Ensure no orphaned or broken references remain
- Test that other MCP servers continue functioning correctly

## Implementation Specifications

### Configuration Standards (from research)
- Absolute paths for all file references
- Python module execution pattern: `python -m package_name`
- Minimal environment variables
- Tool-specific configuration format compliance
- Registry-based installer architecture

### File Locations and Formats
- Respect each tool's expected configuration file locations
- Generate appropriate JSON/TOML format per tool requirements
- Maintain proper schema compliance for each supported tool

### Testing Requirements
- Verify installer works on fresh systems
- Test uninstaller completely removes task orchestrator without affecting other servers
- Validate cross-tool compatibility
- Ensure old malformed configurations are properly cleaned up

## Expected Deliverables

### 1. Audit Report
- Complete analysis of current installer implementation problems
- Specific list of unsafe or incorrect practices identified
- Mapping of current code to documentation standards gaps

### 2. Rebuilt Installer
- New implementation following all documented best practices
- Cross-tool compatibility with proper format handling
- Comprehensive error handling and validation
- Clean, minimal configuration generation

### 3. Enhanced Uninstaller
- Surgical removal of task orchestrator configurations only
- Legacy cleanup capability for old malformed installations
- Safety validation to prevent breaking other MCP servers
- Comprehensive testing of removal completeness

### 4. Testing Suite
- Installation testing on clean systems
- Uninstallation testing with preservation of other MCP servers
- Cross-tool compatibility validation
- Legacy configuration cleanup verification

## Execution Priority
1. **Audit existing implementation** against new documentation standards
2. **Rebuild installer** using documented best practices
3. **Enhance uninstaller** with surgical precision and legacy cleanup
4. **Test thoroughly** to ensure no regression or configuration pollution

## Success Criteria
- Installer follows all documented MCP best practices
- Configurations are clean, minimal, and properly formatted
- Uninstaller removes only task orchestrator without affecting other servers
- Legacy malformed configurations are completely cleaned up
- All supported tools work correctly after installation/uninstallation

Begin with a comprehensive audit of the current installer implementation against the newly created MCP documentation standards.
