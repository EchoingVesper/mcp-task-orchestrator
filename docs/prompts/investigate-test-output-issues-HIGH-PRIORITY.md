# üî¥ HIGH PRIORITY: MCP Task Orchestrator - Test Output & Resource Issues

## Context

During testing of the v1.0 release version of the MCP Task Orchestrator, several issues were identified with the test execution and output display. While the core migration functionality appears to work correctly, the testing infrastructure itself exhibits problems that need to be addressed before final release.

## Issues Identified ‚ö†Ô∏è

### 1. Test Output Truncation

- **Symptom**: When running tests through pytest, output is frequently truncated
- **Impact**: Makes it difficult to verify test results and diagnose failures
- **Observed in**: Multiple test runs with varying verbosity levels

### 2. Resource Warnings

- **Symptom**: `ResourceWarning: unclosed database in <sqlite3.Connection object at 0x...>`
- **Impact**: Potential resource leaks and database connection issues
- **Observed in**: Most test runs, particularly in migration tests

### 3. MCP Tool Hanging

- **Symptom**: The Task Orchestrator MCP tool occasionally hangs during operation
- **Impact**: Interrupts automated workflows and testing processes
- **Observed in**: Attempts to complete subtasks through the orchestrator

## üéØ Objectives

1. **Fix test output truncation** to ensure complete visibility of test results
2. **Resolve resource warnings** by properly closing all database connections
3. **Diagnose and fix MCP tool hanging issues** to ensure reliable operation
4. **Implement comprehensive test error reporting** to improve debugging

## Investigation Strategy

### Phase 1: Output Truncation Issues

1. **Review pytest configuration**:
   - Examine any custom pytest plugins or hooks being used
   - Check for output capture settings that might be limiting display
   - Test with various output formats (plain vs rich)

2. **Test alternative approaches**:
   - Create simplified test runners like the successful `run_migration_test.py`
   - Try different pytest reporters or formatters
   - Implement custom output capture and display mechanism

### Phase 2: Resource Warning Resolution

1. **Database connection audit**:
   - Review all test cases that interact with the database
   - Identify locations where connections might not be properly closed
   - Add explicit connection closing in `finally` blocks

2. **Connection management improvements**:
   - Implement context managers for database operations
   - Consider connection pooling for more efficient resource use
   - Add cleanup hooks to pytest fixtures

### Phase 3: MCP Tool Hanging Investigation

1. **Identify hanging points**:
   - Add detailed logging throughout the orchestration process
   - Implement timeouts and watchdogs for long-running operations
   - Use profiling to identify performance bottlenecks

2. **Concurrency review**:
   - Examine any async operations or threading that might cause deadlocks
   - Review transaction isolation levels and potential lock contention
   - Test with simplified concurrency models

## Expected Outcomes

1. **Reliable test output** that accurately and completely shows test results
2. **No resource warnings** during test execution
3. **Stable MCP tool operation** without hanging
4. **Improved error reporting** for failing tests

## Success Criteria

1. All tests run without output truncation
2. Zero resource warnings in test output
3. MCP tool operations complete without hanging
4. Failed tests provide clear, detailed error information

## Additional Notes

The migration test itself (`test_migration.py`) has been verified to work correctly when run directly, suggesting the core functionality is sound despite the testing infrastructure issues.

## Priority

This investigation should be considered **HIGH PRIORITY** as these issues could mask actual functional problems and need to be resolved before the v1.0 release can be considered production-ready.
