## Performance Benchmark Results

### Core Operations Performance:
- **StateManager initialization**: 0.5937s ✓
- **Get all tasks (90 tasks)**: 0.0225s ✓  
- **Direct parent lookup**: 0.0008s ✓
- **Get single subtask**: 0.0012s ✓
- **Update subtask**: 0.0020s ✓

### Key Findings:

#### ✅ **Core Performance Fix Successful**
- All underlying StateManager operations complete within 5-second threshold
- The critical `update_subtask` operation now takes 0.002s (vs previous 10+ second timeouts)
- Direct parent lookup optimization working perfectly at 0.0008s

#### ⚠️ **MCP Protocol Level Timeout Discovered**
- **Critical Finding**: The `orchestrator_complete_subtask` tool itself times out with "Operation timed out - the system is still processing your request"
- This timeout occurs AFTER the underlying operations complete successfully
- Indicates the bottleneck is in the MCP tool handlers, not the core StateManager

### Root Cause Analysis

The performance fix successfully resolved the **database/StateManager level bottleneck**, but revealed a **higher-level timeout issue** in the MCP protocol layer:

1. **Fixed**: Database operations (0.002s for updates)
2. **Fixed**: StateManager operations (all < 1s) 
3. **Remaining Issue**: MCP tool handler timeouts (occurs after core operations complete)

### Recommendations

1. **Investigate MCP Handler Timeouts**: Focus on the orchestrator tool handlers themselves
2. **Check Protocol Timeouts**: Examine MCP request/response timeout configurations
3. **Handler Optimization**: Review the tool handlers for blocking operations or inefficient patterns

### Success Criteria Status

- ✅ Core orchestrator operations complete within 5 seconds
- ✅ Database performance optimized
- ⚠️ MCP tool integration requires further investigation

The database synchronization fixes have been successful, but there's an additional layer of timeout issues at the MCP protocol/tool handler level that needs addressing.
