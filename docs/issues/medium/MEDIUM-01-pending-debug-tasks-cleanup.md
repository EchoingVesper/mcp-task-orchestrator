# MEDIUM-01: Pending Debug Tasks Cleanup and Resolution

## Priority: ðŸŸ  MEDIUM - TECHNICAL DEBT

## Issue Summary
Multiple debug tasks are stuck in pending state, indicating unresolved system issues that may compound into larger problems.

## Pending Debug Tasks Identified
1. **`debugger_cf0ecc`** - "Analyze Database Operations and Persistence Issues"
2. **`debugger_ebb70f`** - "Trace Artifact Creation Process and Identify Failure Points" 
3. **`debugger_7694e7`** - "Critical Debugging Task - Orchestrator Issue Resolution"

## Associated Issues
- These are likely related to the artifact system failures
- May be blocking other tasks from completing properly
- Could indicate systemic issues with the orchestrator state management

## Resolution Strategy

### Step 1: Analyze Each Debug Task
```python
def analyze_debug_task(task_id):
    task_details = get_task_details(task_id)
    print(f"Task: {task_id}")
    print(f"Created: {task_details.created_at}")
    print(f"Title: {task_details.title}")
    print(f"Dependencies: {task_details.dependencies}")
    print(f"Blocking: {get_tasks_blocked_by(task_id)}")
```

### Step 2: Execute or Archive
- If debug task is still relevant: Execute with current context
- If debug task is superseded: Archive with resolution notes
- If debug task is blocking: Prioritize for immediate resolution

### Step 3: Update Task Dependencies
```python
def resolve_debug_task(task_id, resolution_type):
    if resolution_type == "completed":
        mark_task_completed(task_id, "Resolved via investigation")
    elif resolution_type == "superseded":
        archive_task(task_id, "Issue resolved by other means")
    elif resolution_type == "consolidated":
        consolidate_with_parent_task(task_id)
```

## Implementation Steps
1. **Review each pending debug task** for current relevance
2. **Execute or archive** based on current system state
3. **Update task dependencies** to unblock other work
4. **Document resolutions** for future reference

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All debug tasks either completed or properly archived
- [ ] No tasks blocked by resolved debug tasks
- [ ] Clear documentation of what was found/fixed

## Estimated Time: 1-2 hours for cleanup
