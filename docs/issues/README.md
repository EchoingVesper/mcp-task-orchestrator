# Issue Tracking Index

This directory contains organized issue files for the MCP Task Orchestrator project, sorted by criticality.

**STATUS UPDATE (June 1, 2025)**: Major progress made with **Temporary File Staging System** implementation resolving critical context crash issues.

## ‚úÖ RESOLVED ISSUES

### [‚úÖ CRITICAL-01: Context Crash Prevention](CRITICAL-01-context-crash-prevention.md) - **RESOLVED**
**Issue**: Large `orchestrator_complete_subtask` operations causing Claude Desktop crashes
**Resolution**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** via Temporary File Staging System implementation
**Solution**: Atomic file operations with content streaming prevent context overflow crashes
**Completed**: June 1, 2025

### [‚úÖ HIGH-02: Large Content Intelligent Chunking](HIGH-02-large-content-intelligent-chunking.md) - **RESOLVED**
**Issue**: Need smart content chunking that preserves logical structure
**Resolution**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** via StreamingFileWriter with multiple chunking strategies
**Solution**: Fixed, line-based, paragraph-based, and adaptive chunking strategies implemented
**Completed**: June 1, 2025

## üö® CRITICAL ISSUES (Address Immediately)

### [CRITICAL-02: Artifact Path Resolution Failure](CRITICAL-02-artifact-path-resolution-failure.md) - **PARTIALLY ADDRESSED**
**Issue**: Artifact system creating files in wrong locations or failing silently
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Infrastructure provided by staging system, integration needed
**Priority**: INTEGRATION REQUIRED
**Estimated Fix Time**: 1-2 hours (integration work)

## üî¥ HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES (Address This Week)

### [HIGH-01: Context Limit Detection and Prevention](HIGH-01-context-limit-detection-prevention.md) - **FOUNDATION PROVIDED**
**Issue**: No way to detect approaching context limits before crashes
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Foundation provided by staging system, detection logic needed
**Priority**: DETECTION LOGIC IMPLEMENTATION
**Estimated Fix Time**: 2-3 hours (detection and prevention logic)

## üü† MEDIUM PRIORITY ISSUES (Address Next)

### [MEDIUM-01: Pending Debug Tasks Cleanup](MEDIUM-01-pending-debug-tasks-cleanup.md)
**Issue**: Multiple debug tasks stuck in pending state
**Impact**: Technical debt, may compound into larger problems
**Priority**: TECHNICAL DEBT
**Estimated Fix Time**: 1-2 hours

## üü° LOW PRIORITY ISSUES (Address When Convenient)

### [LOW-01: Module Import Issues in Diagnostics](LOW-01-module-import-issues-diagnostics.md)
**Issue**: Diagnostic scripts failing with import errors
**Impact**: Development convenience, script usability
**Priority**: DEVELOPMENT CONVENIENCE
**Estimated Fix Time**: 30 minutes

## Progress Summary

### ‚úÖ Major Infrastructure Completed
- **Temporary File Staging System**: ‚úÖ Complete infrastructure for safe file operations
- **Context Crash Prevention**: ‚úÖ Large content operations now safe via staging
- **Intelligent Chunking**: ‚úÖ Multiple content chunking strategies implemented
- **Atomic Operations**: ‚úÖ Cross-platform atomic file operations with rollback

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Remaining Work (3-5 hours total)
- **Integration**: Staging system integration with artifact management (1-2 hours)
- **Detection**: Context limit detection and automatic handover (2-3 hours)
- **Cleanup**: Debug tasks and technical debt (1-2 hours)
- **Maintenance**: Minor import and diagnostic fixes (30 minutes)

## Current System Safety Status
- **‚úÖ SAFE**: File operations with staging system (atomic, recoverable)
- **‚úÖ SAFE**: Large content operations via streaming (chunked, managed)
- **‚ö†Ô∏è CAUTION**: Direct artifact operations (integration pending)
- **‚ö†Ô∏è CAUTION**: Very large orchestration (detection system pending)

## Revised Resolution Order
1. **CRITICAL-02** (Staging system integration) - 1-2 hours
2. **HIGH-01** (Context limit detection) - 2-3 hours
3. **MEDIUM-01** (Debug task cleanup) - 1-2 hours
4. **LOW-01** (Import fixes) - 30 minutes

**Original Total Time**: 8-13 hours  
**Remaining Time**: 3-5 hours (Major reduction thanks to staging system)
