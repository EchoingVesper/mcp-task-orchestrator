# MCP Task Orchestrator - Quick Start Guide

Get up and running with AI-powered task orchestration

#
# ðŸŽ¯ What This Does

Transform Claude (or other MCP clients) into an intelligent project manager that breaks down complex tasks into
specialist-driven workflows. **NEW in v1.8.0**: Automatically detects your project workspace and saves files in the
right locations!

**Example:** Ask Claude to *"Build a Python web scraper with testing and documentation"* â†’ Get a structured plan
with architect, implementer, and tester specialists working together, with all artifacts saved in your project directory.

#
# âš¡ Quick Start

#
## Step 1: Prerequisites Check

```bash

# Verify you have these installed:

python --version  

# Should be 3.8+

node --version    

# Should be 16+

```text

#

## Step 2: One-Command Install

#

### From PyPI (Recommended)

```text
bash
pip install mcp-task-orchestrator
mcp-task-orchestrator-cli setup

```text

#

### From Source

```text
bash
git clone https://github.com/EchoingVesper/mcp-task-orchestrator.git
cd mcp-task-orchestrator
python run_installer.py

```text

> **Installation Notice**: This installer is designed to detect common MCP clients and configure them automatically. Troubleshooting may be required for specific system configurations.

#

## Step 3: Restart Your MCP Client

- **Claude Desktop**: Restart the entire app

- **Cursor/VS Code**: Reload window (Ctrl+Shift+P â†’ "Reload Window")

#

## Step 4: Verify It's Working

Open your MCP client and look for `task-orchestrator` in tools/servers. Try saying:
*"Create a task to add a simple hello world function to this project"*

You'll notice the orchestrator automatically:

- Detects your project workspace (Git root, package.json, etc.)

- Creates tasks associated with this specific project

- Saves any artifacts in appropriate project locations

#

## Step 5: Test Workspace Features (Recommended)

Try workspace detection:
*"Check what workspace the orchestrator detected for this project"*

This should show you the detected project root and explain why it chose that location.

#

## ðŸ”§ If Something Goes Wrong

#

## "No MCP clients detected"

1. Install at least one supported client:

- [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download)

- [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/)

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Cline extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=saoudrizwan.claude-dev)

2. Run the client once before installing

3. Re-run `python run_installer.py`

#

## "Could not connect" or "Server failed to start"

1. **Restart your MCP client completely** (most common fix)

2. Check your configuration file was updated:

- **Claude Desktop**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (Mac) or `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` (Windows)

- **Cursor**: `.cursor/mcp.json` in your project or home directory

3. Verify paths are absolute (not relative):

   
```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "task-orchestrator": {
         "command": "/full/path/to/python",  // âœ… Good
         "args": ["-m", "mcp_task_orchestrator.server"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

```text
text

#

## "Module not found" or Import Errors

1. Delete the virtual environment and reinstall:

   
```bash
   rm -rf venv_mcp  
# Linux/Mac
   rmdir /s venv_mcp  
# Windows
   ```

   Then run the installer:

   ```
bash
   python run_installer.py
   ```

#
## Database/Maintenance Issues

1. **Database errors**: Delete `.task_orchestrator/` folder and restart

1. **Maintenance coordinator not responding**: Check if database was properly initialized

1. **Task persistence not working**: Verify `.task_orchestrator/database/` directory exists

#
## Windows-Specific Issues

1. Run Command Prompt as Administrator (not PowerShell)

1. Add Node.js to your PATH manually if needed

1. Use absolute paths in configuration

#
# ðŸ“š What's Next

Once you have it working:

1. **Try a simple task**: *"Plan and implement a basic Python script with error handling"*

1. **Explore specialist roles**: Ask for an architect, implementer, or debugger perspective

1. **Test maintenance features**: *"Use maintenance coordinator to scan and optimize the system"*

1. **Check the status**: Use `orchestrator_get_status` to see task progress  

1. **Read the full docs**: [Complete documentation](docs/) for advanced features including the [Maintenance Coordinator Guide](docs/user-guide/maintenance-coordinator-guide.md)

#
# ðŸ†˜ Still Need Help

1. **Run diagnostics**: `python scripts/diagnostics/verify_tools.py`

1. **Check logs**: Look for `mcp-server-task-orchestrator.log` files

1. **GitHub Issues**: [Report a problem](https://github.com/EchoingVesper/mcp-task-orchestrator/issues)
