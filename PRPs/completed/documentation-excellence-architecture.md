  Implement research-backed documentation excellence patterns for MCP Task Orchestrator
  using modular architecture, automation workflows, and MCP server integration.

---

# Goal

Transform the MCP Task Orchestrator documentation from maintenance burden into project accelerator through systematic implementation of research-backed best practices, comprehensive automation, and user-centered design using a modular 3-folder foundation with progressive disclosure patterns.

# Why

- **User Experience**: Current 326+ scattered markdown files create navigation friction and poor discoverability

- **Maintenance Burden**: Manual documentation maintenance consumes excessive developer time

- **Quality Inconsistency**: Lack of automated quality gates leads to staleness and broken links

- **Scalability Issues**: Current structure doesn't support growing complexity and multiple audiences

- **Integration Opportunity**: Leverage MCP server ecosystem for automated workflows and quality assurance

# What

Implement a modular documentation architecture with:

#

# User-Visible Behavior

- **Progressive Complexity Paths**: 5-minute quick start → intermediate workflows → advanced orchestration

- **Mobile-First Design**: Responsive documentation working across all devices

- **Smart Search**: Enhanced discoverability with contextual recommendations

- **Interactive Examples**: Working code samples with validation

#

# Technical Requirements

- **3-Folder Foundation**: `/users/`, `/developers/`, `/archives/` with specialized content

- **50-200 Line Modules**: Focused, maintainable documentation units

- **Documentation-as-Code**: Git workflow integration with automated quality gates

- **MCP Server Integration**: Automated workflows using filesystem, github, sequential-thinking MCPs

#

# Success Criteria

- [ ] 100% markdownlint compliance across all files

- [ ] Sub-3-second load times on mobile networks

- [ ] 95%+ working code examples with automated validation

- [ ] 80% reduction in manual documentation maintenance

- [ ] User onboarding time matches Rust documentation standards

```text

#

# Known Gotchas & Library Quirks

```text
python

# CRITICAL: MCP servers require allowDangerous: true in WSL environment

# Example: All Puppeteer calls need allowDangerous flag

# CRITICAL: File operations limited to allowed directories

# Use mcp__filesystem__list_allowed_directories first

# CRITICAL: Sequential thinking MCP supports revisions and branching

# Use for complex planning and validation loops

# CRITICAL: Markdownlint rules from CLAUDE.md must be preserved

# Especially blanks-around-headings, ul-indent, fenced-code-language

# CRITICAL: Keep files under 500 lines for Claude Code compatibility

# Large files cause crashes - use modular approach

```text

# Implementation Blueprint

#

# Data Models and Structure

Create modular documentation templates ensuring consistency and maintainability:

```text
python

# Documentation module templates

- Concept modules: 50-100 lines (What + Why focus)

- Procedure modules: 100-150 lines (Step-by-step instructions)  

- Reference modules: 75-125 lines (Comprehensive specifications)

- Troubleshooting modules: 100-200 lines (Problem-solution pairs)

```text

#

# Implementation Tasks

```text
yaml
Task 1 - Foundation Setup:
  CREATE docs/users/ directory structure:
    - MIRROR pattern from: strategy document folder hierarchy
    - IMPLEMENT progressive disclosure paths

# Task 1 Pseudocode

```text
python

# Foundation Setup with MCP Integration

async def setup_documentation_foundation():
    

# PATTERN: Use filesystem MCP for batch operations

    await mcp_filesystem.create_directory("docs/users/quick-start")
    await mcp_filesystem.create_directory("docs/users/guides/basic")
    

# ... create full structure

    
    

# GOTCHA: Preserve existing content during migration

    existing_files = await mcp_filesystem.search_files("docs/", "*.md")
    
    

# PATTERN: Use sequential thinking for complex planning

    migration_plan = await mcp_sequential_thinking.plan_migration(
        existing_files, new_structure
    )
    
    

# CRITICAL: Validate each step before proceeding

    for step in migration_plan:
        await validate_migration_step(step)
        await execute_migration_step(step)

```text

#

# Integration Points

```text
yaml
MCP_SERVERS:
  - configure: Claude Code environment with essential servers
  - pattern: "Always use allowDangerous: true for Puppeteer in WSL"
  
QUALITY_GATES:
  - add to: .github/workflows/
  - pattern: "Automated markdownlint, Vale, and hyperlink validation"
  
NAVIGATION:
  - update: All existing cross-references
  - pattern: "Modular cross-reference system with automated validation"

```text

# Validation Loop

#

# Level 1: Structure & Standards

```text
bash

# Run these FIRST - validate foundation before content migration

# Check markdown compliance

markdownlint docs/ --config .markdownlint.json

# Validate link integrity  

hyperlink --check docs/

# Expected: All structural requirements met before proceeding

```text

#

# Level 2: Content Migration Validation

```python

# Validate each migration step

def test_content_preservation():
    """All existing content preserved during migration"""
    original_content = collect_original_content()
    migrated_content = collect_migrated_content()
    assert content_integrity_check(original_content, migrated_content)

def test_navigation_integrity():
    """All internal links work after migration"""
    links = extract_all_internal_links()
    for link in links:
        assert validate_link_target_exists(link)

def test_module_size_compliance():
    """All modules comply with 50-200 line limits"""
    modules = get_all_documentation_modules()
    for module in modules:
        assert 50 <= count_lines(module) <= 200

```text

```text
bash

# Run content validation

python scripts/validate_migration.py

# If failing: Review migration step, fix issues, re-run validation

```text

#

# Level 3: End-to-End User Experience

```bash

# Test complete user workflows

# Quick start path (5-minute success)

time ./scripts/test_quickstart.sh

# Expected: Successful task orchestration in under 5 minutes

# Mobile performance test

lighthouse --mobile docs/index.html

# Expected: >90 performance score, <3s load time

# Search functionality test

./scripts/test_search_scenarios.sh

# Expected: >95% search success rate for common queries

```text

# Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- ❌ Don't migrate content without preserving existing links and references

- ❌ Don't create modules outside 50-200 line limits  

- ❌ Don't skip mobile optimization - docs must work on phones

- ❌ Don't implement automation without testing failure scenarios

- ❌ Don't break existing user workflows during migration

- ❌ Don't ignore performance metrics - sub-3-second loads required
