# PRP: Comprehensive Markdown Lint Cleanup

#

# Objective

Systematically fix markdownlint warnings across all 326+ markdown files in the repository while preserving
content integrity and improving document structure.

#

# Context

- Repository has 326+ markdown files with extensive markdownlint violations

- Common issues: missing blank lines, incorrect list indentation, unlabeled code blocks

- Need systematic approach to avoid breaking formatting like the aggressive script attempt

- CLAUDE.md has been successfully fixed as a template/reference

#

# Scope

- All `.md` files in repository (326+ files)

- Focus on most common issues: MD022, MD031, MD032, MD007, MD040, MD047

- Preserve all content while improving markdown compliance

- Document patterns for future maintenance

#

# Approach

#

#

# Phase 1: Assessment and Prioritization (Files 1-50)

1. **High-Priority Files**: README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, main docs

1. **Documentation Structure**: Analyze docs/ directory organization

1. **Pattern Identification**: Document common violations and context-specific solutions

#

#

# Phase 2: Systematic Cleanup (Files 51-200)

1. **Batch Processing**: Process files in logical groups (by directory/purpose)

1. **Smart Code Block Labeling**:

- `bash`/`shell` for commands

- `yaml` for configuration files

- `json` for JSON examples

- `text` for plain content like directory listings

- `console` for terminal output

1. **Preserve Formatting**: Maintain intentional formatting patterns

#

#

# Phase 3: Final Cleanup and Validation (Files 201-326+)

1. **Remaining Files**: Process all remaining files

1. **Cross-Reference Validation**: Ensure links and references still work

1. **Final Lint Check**: Run markdownlint across entire repository

#

# Success Criteria

- [ ] All markdown files pass markdownlint validation

- [ ] No content loss or corruption

- [ ] Improved document readability and consistency

- [ ] Documented patterns for future markdown authoring

- [ ] Updated CLAUDE.md guidelines if new patterns discovered

#

# Risk Mitigation

- Process files in small batches with git commits for easy rollback

- Manual review of each file to ensure content preservation

- Test critical documentation flows (installation guides, development workflows)

- Keep backup of original files for comparison

#

# Deliverables

1. **Clean Markdown Files**: All 326+ files compliant with markdownlint

1. **Pattern Documentation**: Common violation patterns and solutions

1. **Updated Guidelines**: Enhanced CLAUDE.md markdown guidelines if needed

1. **Validation Report**: Summary of changes made and lint results

#

# Implementation Notes

- Use the fixed CLAUDE.md as reference for proper formatting

- Focus on content preservation over perfect automation

- Document any repository-specific markdown patterns discovered

- Consider creating markdownlint configuration file for project-specific rules

#

# Estimated Effort

- Phase 1: 2-3 hours (assessment and high-priority files)

- Phase 2: 4-6 hours (systematic processing of bulk files)  

- Phase 3: 2-3 hours (final cleanup and validation)

- Total: 8-12 hours over multiple sessions

#

# Success Metrics

- 100% markdownlint compliance across all .md files

- Zero content loss or link breakage

- Improved document structure and readability

- Reduced future markdown authoring friction
