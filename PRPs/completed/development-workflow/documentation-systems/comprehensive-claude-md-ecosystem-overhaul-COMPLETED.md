# Problem Statement

#
## Current Situation

The MCP Task Orchestrator project has a distributed CLAUDE.md ecosystem with 6 active files across different directories,
but they lack consistency, proper integration, and architectural alignment. Current issues include:

**System-Wide Problems:**

- **Inconsistent Structure**: Each CLAUDE.md file follows different formats and organizational patterns

- **Missing Integration**: Files don't properly cross-reference or work together as a cohesive system

- **File Size Violations**: Main CLAUDE.md (829 lines) severely exceeds Claude Code's 500-line compatibility limit

- **Outdated Information**: Several files reference deprecated patterns (task/subtask model vs unified task model)

- **Poor Architecture Alignment**: Files don't reflect the sophisticated clean architecture and modular documentation approach

**Individual File Analysis:**

- **`/CLAUDE.md`** (829 lines): ⚠️ **CRITICAL** - Exceeds Claude Code limit by 65%, comprehensive but causes crashes

- **`docs/developers/architecture/CLAUDE.md`** (186 lines): ✅ Acceptable size, but inconsistent format

- **`PRPs/CLAUDE.md`** (138 lines): ✅ Good size, needs template alignment  

- **`tests/CLAUDE.md`** (124 lines): ✅ Good size, needs architecture integration

- **`mcp_task_orchestrator/CLAUDE.md`** (91 lines): ✅ Good size, needs clean architecture context

- **`scripts/CLAUDE.md`** (79 lines): ✅ Good size, needs template standardization

**Missing Critical Elements:**

- **Documentation Architecture Guide**: No comprehensive explanation of the sophisticated documentation architecture

- **Cross-Reference Network**: Files don't properly link to create a cohesive navigation system  

- **Template Standardization**: No consistent structure across directory-specific files

- **Clean Architecture Integration**: Files don't explain how they fit into the 4-layer architecture

- **Modular Documentation Patterns**: Missing explanation of the Red Hat modular docs approach implementation

- **Status Tag System**: No application of [CURRENT], [NEEDS-UPDATE] status tracking to CLAUDE.md files themselves

#
## Impact on Development

- **Claude Code Crashes**: Main CLAUDE.md (829 lines) causes Claude Code stability issues for 65% line count excess

- **Developer Confusion**: New contributors struggle to navigate between 6 different CLAUDE.md files with inconsistent formats

- **Inconsistent Development Workflows**: Lack of standardized templates leads to inconsistent directory-specific guidance

- **Maintenance Overhead**: Without systematic integration, maintaining 6 separate files becomes inefficient and error-prone

- **Knowledge Loss**: Sophisticated documentation patterns and architectural insights are scattered and not
  systematically documented

- **Poor Onboarding Experience**: New contributors face overwhelming and inconsistent information architecture

#
# Proposed Solution

#
## Comprehensive CLAUDE.md Ecosystem Overhaul

Transform the entire CLAUDE.md ecosystem into a cohesive, template-driven, architecture-aligned system that includes:

#
### Phase 1: Critical File Size Resolution
