# [IN-PROGRESS] Reorganize PRPs/completed/ Folder - Task PRP

## Context

The `PRPs/completed/` folder contains 30+ completed PRPs in a flat structure that makes it difficult to navigate and
find relevant historical work. A better organization will improve discoverability and serve as a more effective
knowledge base.

### Current State Analysis

**File Categories Identified:**
- **Orchestrator Work** (8 files): ORCHESTRATOR_*, V2_0_ORCHESTRATOR_*
- **Documentation Systems** (7 files): documentation-*, comprehensive-claude-md-*
- **Testing Infrastructure** (4 files): *-testing-*, comprehensive-test-*
- **Command Systems** (3 files): claude-commands-*, TASK_TOOLS_*
- **Error Handling** (3 files): error-handling-*
- **Standards & Cleanup** (4 files): codebase-standards-*, markdown-lint-*
- **PRP Framework** (3 files): prp-system-*, update-prp-*
- **Feature Planning** (2 files): feature-*
- **Infrastructure Fixes** (2 files): CRITICAL_FIXES_*, mcp-task-*
- **Examples & Workshops** (2 files): example-from-workshop-*

## Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Create Directory Structure

```bash
# Create the new directory structure
mkdir -p PRPs/completed/core-systems/{orchestrator,command-framework,database-integration,mcp-protocol}
mkdir -p PRPs/completed/infrastructure/{testing-frameworks,error-handling,performance,security}
mkdir -p PRPs/completed/development-workflow/{documentation-systems,code-standards,prp-framework,ci-cd}
mkdir -p PRPs/completed/features/{user-facing,developer-tools,integrations}
mkdir -p PRPs/completed/maintenance/{refactoring,consolidation,migration,cleanup}
mkdir -p PRPs/completed/examples-and-workshops/{tutorials,patterns,case-studies}
```

### Phase 2: File Classification and Migration

**VALIDATE BEFORE EACH MOVE**: Check file content to confirm categorization

#### Core Systems Files

```bash
# Orchestrator work
mv ORCHESTRATOR_COMPREHENSIVE_TEST_REPORT.md core-systems/orchestrator/
mv ORCHESTRATOR_REPAIR_COMPREHENSIVE_V1-COMPLETED.md core-systems/orchestrator/
mv ORCHESTRATOR_TESTING_STRATEGY.md core-systems/orchestrator/
mv V2_0_ORCHESTRATOR_META_COORDINATOR-COMPLETED.md core-systems/orchestrator/

```

mv fix-documentation-markdownlint-errors.md development-workflow/ci-cd/
mv markdown-lint-cleanup.md development-workflow/ci-cd/
```

#### Maintenance Files

```bash

```

#### Examples and Workshops

```bash
# Case Studies
mv example-from-workshop-mcp-crawl4ai-refactor-1.md examples-and-workshops/case-studies/
```

### Phase 3: Create README Files for Each Category

Each subdirectory should have a README.md explaining:
- Purpose of this category
- Types of PRPs that belong here
- Quick index of major completed work
- Cross-references to related categories

### Phase 4: Update Documentation References

Update any documentation that references the old flat structure:
- Search for hardcoded paths to completed PRPs
- Update CLAUDE.md files if they reference the structure
- Update any automation scripts

## Validation Strategy

### Pre-Migration Validation

```bash
# Count files before migration
find PRPs/completed/ -name "*.md" -type f | wc -l

# Create backup
cp -r PRPs/completed/ PRPs/completed-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)
```

### Post-Migration Validation  

```bash
# Verify all files moved
find PRPs/completed/ -maxdepth 1 -name "*.md" -type f | wc -l  # Should be 0
find PRPs/completed/ -name "*.md" -type f | wc -l              # Should match original count

# Check for broken symbolic links
find PRPs/completed/ -type l -exec test ! -e {} \; -print

# Validate directory structure
tree PRPs/completed/ -d
```

### Content Validation

```bash
# Check each moved file exists and is readable
for category in core-systems infrastructure development-workflow features maintenance examples-and-workshops; do
  echo "Checking $category..."
  find PRPs/completed/$category/ -name "*.md" -exec head -1 {} \; | grep -c "^#"
done
```

## Rollback Plan

If migration fails:

```bash
# Remove new structure and restore backup
rm -rf PRPs/completed/
mv PRPs/completed-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d) PRPs/completed/
```

## Benefits of New Structure

1. **Discoverability**: Logical grouping makes finding relevant PRPs easier
2. **Knowledge Organization**: Related work is co-located
3. **Onboarding**: New team members can understand completed work by category
4. **Pattern Recognition**: Similar implementations are grouped together
5. **Maintenance**: Easier to identify outdated or redundant work
6. **Cross-References**: Related PRPs are physically near each other

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All 30+ files successfully categorized and moved
- [ ] No files lost during migration
- [ ] Directory structure matches proposed design
- [ ] Each category has descriptive README.md
- [ ] No broken references in documentation
- [ ] Structure validated by team review
- [ ] Backup created and verified
- [ ] Rollback procedure tested

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| File loss during move | High | Low | Create backup before starting |
| Incorrect categorization | Medium | Medium | Review file contents before moving |
| Broken documentation links | Medium | High | Search and update all references |
| Git history fragmentation | Low | High | Use `git mv` for moves |
| Team confusion | Medium | Low | Communicate changes clearly |

## Implementation Notes

- Use `git mv` instead of `mv` to preserve file history
- Consider creating index files for each category
- Add category information to file headers
- Update .gitignore if needed for new structure
- Test the structure with a few files first

## Context References

```yaml
patterns:
  - file: docs/developers/contributing/
    copy: Documentation organization patterns
  - file: PRPs/templates/
    copy: Existing PRP categorization

gotchas:
  - issue: "Moving files loses git history"
    fix: "Use git mv instead of mv command"
  - issue: "Hard to categorize some files"
    fix: "Review file content, not just filename"
```

**Status**: Ready for Implementation  
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours  
**Complexity**: Moderate (mostly organizational, low technical risk)  
**Dependencies**: None  
**Blocking**: None
