# PRP: Feature Planning Documentation Reorganization and Standardization

**PRP ID**: `FEATURE_PLANNING_REORG_V1`
**Created**: 2025-07-07
**Confidence Score**: 8/10
**Estimated Effort**:

- Phase 1 (Analysis): 2-3 hours (5-6 minutes per feature × 30+ features)

- Phase 2 (User Decisions): 1-2 hours (3-4 minutes per decision × 20 features)

- Phase 3 (Reorganization): 1 hour (automated with validation)

- Phase 4 (Standardization): 2 hours (4-5 minutes per feature × 30+ features)

- Phase 5 (Documentation): 1 hour

- Total: 7-9 hours (plus user decision time)

#
# 📋 Overview

This PRP guides the reorganization and standardization of all feature planning documentation in the MCP Task
Orchestrator project. The goal is to:

1. Analyze every feature file to determine actual implementation status

2. **Collaborate with user on version assignment for incomplete features**

3. Reorganize features into an expanded version structure (2.0 through 3.0+)

4. Standardize all features using the official template

5. Update main planning documents with accurate links

**Key Addition**: For each feature discovered that is not yet completely implemented, the Claude Code instance
will work with the user to decide whether that specific feature should be part of the 2.0 release or delayed
to a later release. The 2.0 release should be fairly comprehensive, and some features may be moved sooner
based on user preference and discussion.

## Key Findings

- **Generic Task Model**: Listed as [RESEARCH] but actually implemented

- **Duplicate Features**: Some features appear in multiple folders

- **Version Limitation**: Only goes up to 2.1, needs expansion

- **Template Compliance**: Many features don't follow standard template

# 🎯 Implementation Blueprint

#
## Phase 1: Feature Analysis and Classification (2-3 hours)

1. **Feature Analysis Checklist**

   ```
python
   
# Comprehensive feature analysis checklist
   FEATURE_ANALYSIS_CHECKLIST = {
       "implementation": [
           "Check for domain entities",
           "Check for use cases", 
           "Check for MCP tools",
           "Check for database tables",
           "Check for infrastructure components",
           "Check for test coverage"
       ],
       "documentation": [
           "Has overview section",
           "Has objectives defined",
           "Has implementation details",
           "Has success metrics",
           "Follows template structure"
       ],
       "metadata": [
           "Has feature ID",
           "Has priority assigned",
           "Has complexity rating",
           "Has effort estimate",
           "Has dependencies listed"
       ]
   }
   
```text

2. **Check Implementation Status**

   ```
python
   
# For each feature file, check if implemented:
   
# Use IMPLEMENTATION_PATTERNS dict defined in Critical Context section
   for feature_name, patterns in IMPLEMENTATION_PATTERNS.items():
       is_implemented, evidence = check_implementation(feature_name, patterns)
       confidence, level = calculate_implementation_confidence(evidence, patterns)
   
```text

3. **Create Implementation Status Map**

   ```
yaml
   features:
     - name: "Generic Task Model Design"
       file: "research/[RESEARCH]_generic_task_model_design.md"
       status: "implemented"
       evidence: ["mcp_task_orchestrator/orchestrator/generic_models.py exists"]
       target_version: "2.0-completed"
   
```text

#
## Phase 2: Feature Classification and User Collaboration (2 hours)

1. **Create Feature Decision Report**

   ```
markdown
   
# Feature Classification Report for User Review
   
   
## Features Requiring Version Assignment Decision
   
   
### Feature: [Feature Name]
- **Current Status**: Not fully implemented
- **Implementation Evidence**: [List any partial implementation found]
- **Original Target**: [From roadmap if available]
- **Complexity**: [High|Medium|Low]
- **Dependencies**: [List any dependencies]
   
   **Recommendation**: Place in 2.0-in-progress or 2.1-approved?
   **Rationale**: [Provide reasoning for recommendation]
   
   **USER DECISION NEEDED**: Should this be part of 2.0 release?
   
```text

2. **Interactive Decision Process**

   For each feature that is not yet completely implemented:
- Present feature details to user
- Explain current implementation status
- Provide recommendation for version placement
- Wait for user decision on whether to include in 2.0 or delay
- Document user's decision and reasoning

3. **Create Expanded Version Structure**

   ```
bash
   features/
   ├── 2.0-in-progress/    
# User-approved for v2.0, needs completion
   ├── 2.0-completed/      
# Actually implemented in v2.0
   ├── 2.1-approved/       
# Next release (user-deferred from 2.0)
   ├── 2.2-planned/        
# Template systems, A2A foundation
   ├── 2.3-planned/        
# Analytics and ML
   ├── 3.0-vision/         
# Long-term vision
   ├── research/           
# True research/exploration
   ├── archived/           
# Obsolete or rejected
   └── templates/          
# Keep template location
   
```text

4. **Move Features Based on Analysis and User Decisions**
- Use implementation status map
- Apply user decisions for incomplete features
- Check Feature-Roadmap.md for version assignments
- Preserve git history with proper moves

#
## Phase 3: Feature Standardization (2 hours)

1. **Template Structure** (@docs/developers/planning/features/templates/feature-specification-template.md)

   ```
markdown
   
# 🔧 Feature Specification: [Feature Name]
   
   **Feature ID**: `[UNIQUE_FEATURE_ID]`
   **Priority**: [High|Medium|Low]
   **Category**: [Core Infrastructure|User Experience|Integration|Performance|Quality]
   **Estimated Effort**: [Time estimate]
   **Created**: [YYYY-MM-DD]
   **Status**: [Proposed|Approved|In-Progress|Completed|Archived]

#
# 🔧 Implementation Steps

#
## Step 1: Initialize Tracking

```text
python

# Create tracking structure

tracking = {
    "analyzed": [],
    "moved": [],
    "standardized": [],
    "errors": []
}

```text

#
## Step 2: Analyze Each Feature

```text
python
for feature_file in all_feature_files:
    
# 1. Read feature content
    content = read_file(feature_file)
    
    
# 2. Extract feature name and current status
    feature_name = extract_feature_name(content)
    current_status = extract_status(content)
    
    
# 3. Check implementation
    is_implemented, evidence = check_implementation(feature_name)
    
    
# 4. Classify feature
    if is_implemented:
        target_version = "2.0-completed"
    else:
        
# Add to decisions needed list
        tracking["needs_decision"].append({
            "file": feature_file,
            "name": feature_name,
            "current_status": current_status,
            "evidence": evidence,
            "complexity": extract_complexity(content),
            "dependencies": extract_dependencies(content)
        })
        target_version = "TBD_USER_DECISION"
    
    
# 5. Record in tracking
    tracking["analyzed"].append({
        "file": feature_file,
        "name": feature_name,
        "implemented": is_implemented,
        "target": target_version
    })

```text

#
## Step 2.5: Interactive User Decision Process

```text
python

# Generate decision report for user

decision_report = []
for feature in tracking["needs_decision"]:
    report_section = f"""

#
## Feature: {feature['name']}

- **File**: {feature['file']}

- **Current Status**: {feature['current_status']}

- **Implementation Evidence**: {'; '.join(feature['evidence']) if feature['evidence'] else 'None found'}

- **Complexity**: {feature['complexity']}

- **Dependencies**: {', '.join(feature['dependencies']) if feature['dependencies'] else 'None'}

**Recommendation**: {'2.0-in-progress' if feature['complexity'] in ['Low', 'Medium'] else '2.1-approved'}
**Rationale**: {generate_rationale(feature)}

**USER DECISION NEEDED**: Should this feature be included in the 2.0 release?
"""
    decision_report.append(report_section)

# Present to user and collect decisions

print("\n".join(decision_report))
user_decisions = collect_user_decisions(tracking["needs_decision"])

# Update tracking with user decisions

for feature, decision in user_decisions.items():
    
# Update target version based on user decision
    for item in tracking["analyzed"]:
        if item["name"] == feature:
            item["target"] = decision["version"]
            item["user_reasoning"] = decision["reasoning"]

```text

#
## Step 3: Reorganize Features

```text
python

# Create new directories

for version in ["2.0-completed", "2.1-approved", "2.2-planned", "2.3-planned", "3.0-vision"]:
    create_directory(f"features/{version}")

# Move features

for feature in tracking["analyzed"]:
    old_path = feature["file"]
    new_path = f"features/{feature['target']}/{basename(old_path)}"
    move_file(old_path, new_path)
    tracking["moved"].append({"from": old_path, "to": new_path})

```text

#
## Step 4: Standardize Features

```text
python
template = read_template("features/templates/feature-specification-template.md")

for feature in tracking["moved"]:
    
# 1. Read current content
    content = read_file(feature["to"])
    
    
# 2. Parse into sections
    sections = parse_markdown_sections(content)
    
    
# 3. Map to template structure
    standardized = map_to_template(sections, template)
    
    
# 4. Write standardized version
    write_file(feature["to"], standardized)
    tracking["standardized"].append(feature["to"])

```text

#
## Step 5: Update Planning Documents

```text
python

# Update Feature-Roadmap.md

roadmap = read_file("Feature-Roadmap.md")
for version in version_structure:
    features = get_features_for_version(version)
    roadmap = update_version_section(roadmap, version, features)
write_file("Feature-Roadmap.md", roadmap)

# Update V2.0-Current-Status.md

status = read_file("V2.0-Current-Status.md")
completed_features = get_features_for_version("2.0-completed")
status = update_completed_section(status, completed_features)
write_file("V2.0-Current-Status.md", status)

## Claude Code MCP Tools Usage

From @PRPs/ai_docs/cc_mcp.md:

- Use `mcp__filesystem__read_file` for reading files

- Use `mcp__filesystem__write_file` for updates

- Use `mcp__filesystem__list_directory` for directory scanning

- Batch operations when possible for performance

## User Decision Criteria Guidelines

When presenting features for user decision, provide these criteria to help guide choices:

```text
python
DECISION_CRITERIA = {
    "include_in_2.0": [
        "Core functionality that other features depend on",
        "Features with partial implementation that can be completed quickly",
        "High user value with low-to-medium complexity",
        "Features that enhance the 2.0 release comprehensiveness",
        "Infrastructure features that enable future capabilities"
    ],
    "defer_to_2.1": [
        "Nice-to-have features that aren't critical",
        "High complexity features needing extensive work",
        "Features with unresolved dependencies",
        "Experimental features needing more research",
        "Features that could destabilize 2.0 if rushed"
    ],
    "user_preferences": [
        "The user wants 2.0 to be fairly comprehensive",
        "Some features may be moved sooner based on discussion",

# Archive original bundle file
    archive_file(feature_file, "features/archived/bundles/")

```text

#
# ✅ Validation Gates

#
## 1. Pre-Implementation Checks

```text
bash

# Verify all feature files are accounted for

find docs/developers/planning/features -name "*.md" -type f | wc -l

# Should match tracked file count

# Check for git uncommitted changes

git status --porcelain docs/developers/planning/

# Should be clean before starting

```text

#
## 2. Post-Reorganization Validation

```python

# Verify no files lost

original_files = set(find_all_features_before())
final_files = set(find_all_features_after())
assert original_files == final_files, "Files mismatch!"

# Verify directory structure

for version in EXPECTED_VERSIONS:
    assert os.path.exists(f"features/{version}"), f"Missing {version} directory"

# Verify no broken links

for doc in ["Feature-Roadmap.md", "V2.0-Current-Status.md"]:
    links = extract_feature_links(doc)
    for link in links:
        assert os.path.exists(link), f"Broken link: {link}"

```text

#
## 3. Template Compliance Check

```text
python

# Check all features follow template

for feature_file in all_feature_files:
    content = read_file(feature_file)
    
    
# Required sections
    assert "
# 🔧 Feature Specification:" in content
    assert "**Feature ID**:" in content
    assert "**Status**:" in content
    assert "
## 📋 Overview" in content
    
    
# Valid status
    status = extract_field(content, "Status")
    assert status in ["Proposed", "Approved", "In-Progress", "Completed", "Archived"]

```text

#
## 4. Final Validation

```text
bash

# Markdown lint check

markdownlint docs/developers/planning/ --config .markdownlint.json

# Git diff review

git diff --stat docs/developers/planning/

# Should show organized changes

```text

#
# ⚠️ Error Handling

#
## Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Malformed Feature Files**

   
```python
   try:
       sections = parse_markdown(content)
   except ParseError:
       
# Log error and skip standardization
       tracking["errors"].append({
           "file": feature_file,
           "error": "Malformed markdown",
           "action": "Manual review needed"
       })
   ```

2. **Duplicate Features**

   ```
python
   
# Detect and handle duplicates
   feature_index = {}
   for feature_file in all_features:
       feature_id = extract_feature_id(feature_file)
       if feature_id in feature_index:
           
# Compare files
           file1 = feature_index[feature_id]
           file2 = feature_file
           
           
# Keep newer/larger file
           if get_file_mtime(file2) > get_file_mtime(file1):
               archive_file(file1, f"archived/duplicates/{timestamp}/")
               feature_index[feature_id] = file2
           else:
               archive_file(file2, f"archived/duplicates/{timestamp}/")
       else:
           feature_index[feature_id] = feature_file
   
```text

3. **Missing Required Fields**

   ```
python
   DEFAULT_VALUES = {
       "Priority": "Medium",
       "Category": "Core Infrastructure",
       "Estimated Effort": "TBD",
       "Created": datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d"),
       "Status": "Proposed"
   }
   
   def add_missing_fields(content, defaults=DEFAULT_VALUES):
       for field, default in defaults.items():
           if f"**{field}**:" not in content:
               
# Add with comment
               content = content.replace(
                   "**Feature ID**:",
                   f"**Feature ID**:\n**{field}**: {default} <!-- NEEDS_UPDATE -->"
               )
       return content
   
```text

4. **Implementation Status Conflicts**

   ```
python
   
# Handle features marked as research but actually implemented
   if feature_status == "research" and is_implemented:
       
# Update status and add note
       content = update_status(content, "Completed")
       content = add_note(content, 
           "NOTE: Marked as research but implementation found. " +
           f"Evidence: {', '.join(evidence)}"
       )
   
```text

5. **Special Case: PRP Integration**

   ```
python
   
# Handle the prp-integration.md file specially
   if "prp-integration.md" in feature_file:
       
# This describes PRP process, not a feature
       
# Move to documentation instead
       move_to = "docs/developers/processes/prp-integration.md"
       tracking["special_cases"].append({
           "file": feature_file,
           "reason": "Process documentation, not feature",
           "action": f"Moved to {move_to}"
       })
   
```text

#
## Rollback Strategy

```text
bash

# Before starting, create backup branch

git checkout -b feature-reorg-backup
git checkout main

# If errors occur, rollback

git checkout docs/developers/planning/ 
git clean -fd docs/developers/planning/

```text
