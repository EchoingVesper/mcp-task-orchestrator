# Comprehensive MCP Tools Systematic Testing PRP

name: "Comprehensive MCP Tools Systematic Testing"
description: |
  Systematic testing of all 16 MCP Task Orchestrator tools with 3x validation per tool,
  immediate issue resolution, and comprehensive progress tracking using the task orchestrator
  itself to aid in the testing process.

---

#
# Goal

Implement and execute a comprehensive testing framework that systematically validates all 16 MCP Task Orchestrator tools with triple validation per tool (Basic → Edge Cases → Integration), immediate issue resolution when problems are discovered, and real-time progress tracking through a checkbox system. The testing must be thorough enough to prove 100% functionality before archiving the PRP.

#
# Why

- **Production Readiness**: Ensure all 16 tools are production-ready and fully functional

- **Quality Assurance**: Implement systematic testing that catches issues before deployment

- **Confidence Building**: Provide concrete evidence that the orchestrator is reliable

- **Issue Prevention**: Identify and fix problems immediately rather than discovering them later

- **Progress Transparency**: Real-time tracking of testing progress with clear success/failure indicators

- **Self-Validation**: Use the orchestrator itself to manage and track the testing process

#
# What

A comprehensive testing system that:

1. **Tests each tool individually** with 3x validation levels per tool

2. **Implements immediate issue resolution** when problems are discovered

3. **Uses checkbox tracking** for real-time progress monitoring

4. **Leverages the orchestrator** for test management and coordination

5. **Provides detailed reporting** with failure analysis and resolution steps

6. **Ensures 100% success rate** before marking the PRP as complete

#
## Success Criteria

- [ ] All 16 MCP Task Orchestrator tools pass 3x validation (Basic, Edge Cases, Integration)

- [ ] Checkbox tracking system implemented and actively maintained

- [ ] Immediate issue resolution workflows operational

- [ ] Comprehensive test framework with automated execution

- [ ] Real-time progress tracking with detailed reporting

- [ ] 100% tool functionality validation before PRP completion

## Known Gotchas & Library Quirks

```text
python

# CRITICAL: MCP tools require proper async handling

# All tool calls must be awaited: await route_tool_call(tool_name, args)

# CRITICAL: Database connections must be properly managed

# Use context managers from tests/utils/db_test_utils.py

# CRITICAL: State management persistence

# StateManager initializes in constructor - no separate initialize() method

# CRITICAL: Reboot tools require proper sequence

# Must check health before restart, shutdown prepare before restart

# CRITICAL: Tool response format validation

# All tools return List[types.TextContent] with JSON content

# CRITICAL: Error handling patterns

# Tools return JSON with success/error fields, not Python exceptions

# CRITICAL: Resource cleanup

# Always clean up test artifacts to prevent ResourceWarnings

#
## Level 3: Systematic Testing of All 16 Tools

```text
bash

# Execute comprehensive testing of all tools

cd /mnt/e/dev/mcp-servers/mcp-task-orchestrator
source venv/bin/activate
python tests/validation_gates/test_runner.py --run-all --stop-on-failure

# Expected: All 16 tools pass 3x validation

# If any tool fails: Issue resolution workflows activate automatically

# Progress tracking updates in real-time

```text

#
## Level 4: Issue Resolution & Recovery Testing

```bash

# Test issue resolution workflows

python tests/validation_gates/test_runner.py --simulate-failures --test-recovery

# Test with corrupted database

python tests/validation_gates/test_runner.py --corrupt-db --test-recovery

# Test with server issues

python tests/validation_gates/test_runner.py --server-issues --test-recovery

# Expected: All issues resolved automatically, testing continues

```text

#
## Level 5: Progress Tracking & Reporting Validation

```bash

# Validate progress tracking system

python tests/validation_gates/progress_tracking.py --validate-tracking

# Generate comprehensive progress report

python tests/validation_gates/progress_tracking.py --generate-report

# Verify checkbox file updates

python tests/validation_gates/progress_tracking.py --verify-checkboxes

# Expected: Real-time progress tracking, accurate reporting

```text

#
# Final Validation Checklist

- [ ] All 16 tools pass basic functionality validation

- [ ] All 16 tools pass edge case validation  

- [ ] All 16 tools pass integration validation

- [ ] Checkbox tracking system updates in real-time

- [ ] Issue resolution workflows resolve problems automatically

- [ ] Progress tracking provides accurate statistics

#
# Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- ❌ Don't skip validation levels - all 3 must pass per tool

- ❌ Don't ignore test failures - resolve immediately before continuing

- ❌ Don't test multiple tools simultaneously - focus on one at a time

- ❌ Don't hardcode test data - use dynamic generation

- ❌ Don't skip cleanup - resource warnings indicate problems

- ❌ Don't rely on manual testing - automate everything

- ❌ Don't proceed without 100% success - fix all issues first

- ❌ Don't forget progress tracking - update checkboxes in real-time
