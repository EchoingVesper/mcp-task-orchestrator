# Release Preparation & PR Management - Implementation Task

**PRP ID**: `RELEASE_PREP_V1`  
**Type**: Task Implementation  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days  
**Dependencies**: All previous tasks completed, commits organized  

#
# Task Overview

Final preparation for the 2.0 release including PR management, release validation, deployment preparation, and release coordination. Decide whether to update existing PR #43 or create a new comprehensive PR for the 2.0 release.

#
# Release Preparation Strategy

#
## 1. PR Assessment and Decision

#
### Evaluate Current PR #43

```bash

# Analyze current PR state

gh pr view 43 --json title,body,commits,changedFiles,reviews

# Check PR scope and relevance to 2.0

gh pr diff 43 | wc -l  
# Check size of changes
gh pr status 43        
# Check current status

```text

#
### Decision Criteria for PR #43

**Update Existing PR if:**

- Current changes align with 2.0 scope

- PR is manageable size and reviewable

- Branch is clean and properly organized

- No conflicts with new 2.0 architecture

**Create New PR if:**

- Current PR scope is too limited for 2.0

- Changes are incompatible with 2.0 architecture

- Better to have fresh start for major release

- Current PR has unresolved conflicts or issues
