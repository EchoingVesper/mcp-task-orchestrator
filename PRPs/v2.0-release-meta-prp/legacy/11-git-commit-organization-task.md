# Git Commit Organization & Atomic Commits - Implementation Task

**PRP ID**: `GIT_COMMIT_ORG_V1`  
**Type**: Task Implementation  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days  
**Dependencies**: Repository cleanup completed  

#
# Task Overview

Organize the 414 modified files into logical, atomic commits that properly represent the development work done for the 2.0 release. Create a clean, professional commit history suitable for a major release.

#
# Current State Analysis

Based on git status, we have:

- **Modified files**: Numerous files across all directories

- **Renamed files**: Many files moved during documentation reorganization

- **Deleted files**: Legacy files and deprecated functionality

- **New files**: 2.0 features, tests, and documentation

#
# Commit Organization Strategy

#
## 1. Atomic Commit Principles

Each commit should:

- **Single Purpose**: Address one logical change

- **Complete**: Not break the system when applied

- **Descriptive**: Clear commit message explaining the change

- **Reviewable**: Reasonable size for code review

#
