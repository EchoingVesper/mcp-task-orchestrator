## Executive Dysfunction (ED) Score Criteria

Each feature is scored on accessibility:
- **10/10**: Works perfectly on "barely functional" days
- **8/10**: Minor friction points remain
- **6/10**: Functional but requires some energy
- **4/10**: Significant barriers present
- **2/10**: Only works on good days
- **0/10**: Not accessible

## Risk Register

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Feature complexity overwhelming | HIGH | Break into smaller subtasks, delegate to agents |
| Integration conflicts | MEDIUM | Use git worktrees for isolation |
| Performance regression | MEDIUM | Continuous benchmarking |
| Accessibility compromise | HIGH | ED review at each milestone |
